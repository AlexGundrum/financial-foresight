# Frontend Setup Instructions for Tom

Hey Tom, run these commands in your terminal to get the frontend running after you've cloned the main repository.

**1. Switch to the Correct Branch:**
   (Make sure you are in the main repository folder, NOT the 'frontend' folder yet)
   ```bash
   git checkout frontend-dev
   git pull origin frontend-dev

cd frontend

npm install

npm run dev

Open in Browser:
Go to: http://localhost:3000 (or whatever URL the terminal shows)
